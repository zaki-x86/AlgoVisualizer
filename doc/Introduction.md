# AlgoViz: Educational tool to bring algorithms to life

AlgoViz is an educational tool that uses simple visual effects to make algorithms come to life. With its easy-to-use interface, you can select the algorithm you want to visualize and control the execution of the simulation with simple buttons. The app's dark mode theme adds a touch of sophistication to the experience. AlgoViz provides simple descriptions and visual simulations that illustrate how the algorithms work internally, helping you to better understand them.

## Features

- Simple interface with selection buttons, a main view, control buttons, and a status bar.
- Dark mode theme for now, but considering adding an option for light mode.
- Visual simulations and simple descriptions that bring algorithms to life.
- Control the execution of the simulation with play, pause, speed (spin box), and reset buttons.
- Status bar shows app status, whether running, idle, or an algorithm 'x' is selected.
